Given a desired football team formation (e.g., 4-3-3), provide an array of objects representing the strongest XI for that team based on:

Player names and jersey numbers: Include full names and assigned jersey numbers for each player.
Optional jersey names: Include nicknames or shortened names used on jerseys, if available.
FC 24 penalty ratings: Access and incorporate ethically sourced FC 24 penalty ratings for each player.
Sorting and goalkeeper placement: Sort the array by penalty ratings (descending) and place the goalkeeper (identified by position) last.
Additional Notes:

Specify the context for the "strongest XI" (e.g., specific match, general World Cup consideration).
Indicate preferred language for code examples (e.g., JavaScript, Python).
Clarify desired formatting for the player objects (e.g., camelCase, snake_case).
Example Usage:

"I want the strongest Germany XI as a 4-3-3 for the World Cup 2022 in JavaScript, with player objects using snake_case formatting."
